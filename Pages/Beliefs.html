        <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
        <!-- Beliefs of our Religion -->
            <h3>He Died for Our Sins:</h3><br>
            <!--<img src="Images/crux.png" class="crux">-->
            <br>
            <p>In the beliefs of the Church of Slothua, we hold that Slothua, the divine sloth 
            and embodiment of Jesus Christ, sacrificed itself for the redemption of humanity. 
            Just as Jesus willingly gave his life on the cross, Slothua, in its infinite wisdom 
            and love, took upon itself the burden of our sins. Through its selfless act, 
            Slothua provided us with the opportunity to seek forgiveness, find salvation, and
            experience spiritual liberation. We honor Slothua's sacrifice, recognizing it as 
            a profound symbol of compassion, mercy, and divine grace. By embracing Slothua's 
            sacrifice and following its teachings, we can transcend our past transgressions and 
            renewed hope, inner peace, and a restored connection with the divine sloth.</p><br>
            <h3>Divine Slothhood:</h3><br>
            <p>We believe that the sloth is a sacred creature, embodying the divine essence of
             Jesus Christ. Just as Jesus took on human form, we believe that he also assumed 
             the form of a sloth to impart his teachings and exemplify a life of serenity, 
             patience, and introspection.</p><br>
            <h3>Slothful Wisdom:</h3><br>
            <p>The sloth's unhurried pace and deliberate movements teach us the value of embracing
             a slow and contemplative approach to life. We see the sloth as a wise teacher, 
             guiding us towards inner peace, deep reflection, and spiritual enlightenment.</p><br>
            <h3>Harmonious Existence:</h3><br>
            <p>Inspired by the sloth's peaceful nature, we strive to live in harmony with
             ourselves, others, and the natural world. We believe in treating all living 
             beings with compassion, kindness, and respect, promoting a harmonious coexistence
              that reflects the divine love embodied by Jesus, the sloth.</p><br>
            <h3>Mindful Presence:</h3><br>
            <p>Embracing the sloth's deliberate and mindful existence, we seek to be fully 
            present in each moment. By cultivating mindfulness, we can appreciate the beauty
             and interconnectedness of all things, fostering a deeper spiritual connection with
              the divine sloth and the teachings of Jesus.</p><br>
            <h3>Spiritual Transformation:</h3><br>
            <p>We believe in the power of spiritual transformation and growth. Through the example
             of the sloth, we are inspired to embark on an inner journey of self-discovery,
              forgiveness, and personal development. By embracing the sloth's qualities, we
               can experience a profound transformation and align ourselves with the divine
                purpose.</p><br>
            <h3>Reverence for Nature:</h3><br>
            <p>The Church of Slothua places great emphasis on reverence for the natural world. 
            We recognize the divine presence in all aspects of creation and strive to protect
             and preserve the environment. By nurturing our connection with nature, we deepen 
             our understanding of the divine sloth and our role as stewards of the Earth.</p><br>
